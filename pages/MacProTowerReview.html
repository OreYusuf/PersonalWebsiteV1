    <p>Apples latest beast â€“ The Mac Pro. After 6 years the new computer announced at WWDC 2019, showcases Appleâ€™s genius in technology once again.
    And this time it seems for the foreseeable future, theyâ€™ve made a lasting mark.
    From design to sheer computation power Apple have leaped frogged their â€˜Proâ€™ user base ahead of the pack. </p>

    <br></br>

    <p>Prior to release, Apple shipped several units to a number of tech youtubers to review and conduct unboxings.
    MKBHD and IJustine were two youtubers whom videos Iâ€™ve watched for years and to see them be the first to play with the new machineâ€™s
    was not too much of a surprise given they would fall into the main demographic of users given their extreme video editing workflows.
    The machines featured the following: </p>

    <br></br>

    <ul>
      <li> 28-Core Intel Xeon W Processors </li>
      <li> 383gb RAM </li>
      <li> 4TB SSD </li>
      <li>Afterburner Card </li>
      <li>  Two AMD Radeon Pro Vega II GPUâ€™s </li>
    </ul>

    <p> According to the Appleâ€™s Website this comes out to an eye-watering Â£27,099.00! This is not the fully specâ€™d version either,
    1.5 of DDR4 ECC memory; Two Radeon Pro Vega II Duo; 8TB SSD storage; Â£400 wheels (more on this later) pushes the price up
     to a blistering Â£53,299.00.  Although the machine can be picked up for Â£5,499.00 at its minimum spec.
    The price although reflecting state of the art components has me contemplating what would
    I have to be working on to justify; A â€“ Spending Â£50,000 on a machine; B â€“ How I would get together Â£50,000 ðŸ˜–;
    C â€“ Does this machine REALLY justify that price?
    Given I donâ€™t have Â£5,500 spare to buy the base model, I will be reviewing based solely on reputable opinions. </p>

    <h2> The Design </h2>

    <p>Modern, seamless â€˜seamfullnessâ€™ and futurist to say the least.
    The cast aluminium housing has a front facia with a lattice pattern
    of three-dimensional interlocking hemispheres, which Apple based on a naturally occurring phenomenon
    in molecular crystal structures (Yesâ€¦ I copied that from google). The design is the most unique Iâ€™ve ever seen,
    the concavity of the â€˜hemispheresâ€™ catches your attention and, in my opinion, demands attention in any technical
    space youâ€™d find it, theyâ€™d simply be nothing like it.
    Apple made the logic board dual sided to make it simple to add and remove components to the Mac Pro.
    The processor, graphics, and expansion are located on one side, while the storage and memory are on the other.
    Repairbilty and scalability were obvous design philiophiyes in my opinion as were the previous versions
    but the â€˜openessâ€™ to all the components is notable. </p>

    <br></br>

     <p>The high-end components featured in the Mac Pro draw a lot of power, thus Apple built the machine with an impressive thermal architecture.
    There are three impeller fans that push air across the CPU and GPU, and on the opposite side, there's a blower to pull air across the memory, storage, and through the power supply, venting it out of the back.
    Again compared to the apple â€˜trash canâ€™ this is notable as in my opinion functionally always come first, design can always be fitted to the functionality and not the other way around (unless you work for Gucci).
    The thermal based architecture from the hardware to the physical design should ensure for decades to come the components perform optimally and as mentioned scalability is possible, it wouldnâ€™t be a misjudgement to state more power == more heat.
    Thus going forward this machine should act as a good home for those newer components. </p>

    <h2> More About The Insides </h2>

     <p>As forementioned the internals to the machine is really the selling point, Apple have never used more powerful components into a Mac.
    The machine can support two MPX modules or four PCI express card slots, from my understanding the MPX slots are where the Radeon Pro Vega cards
    go and thus there maybe space to many more as there are various other slots with a total of 8.
    I canâ€™t seem to find conclusive information as to whether users are actually able to use all the slots at once but given itâ€™s a device for professionals (and the price)
    I doubt theyâ€™d cheap out on ensuring the architecture can handle all slots being used or is the case with the higher specâ€™d machines, there is more than enough graphics
    computation going on for you to even want to upgrade. </p>

    <br></br>

     <p> CPU, RAM and graphics â€“ not much to say on these. Impressive the machine can handle these but for the most part PCâ€™s have or can contain the same hardware.  </p>

    <br></br>

     <p>Afterburner Card, apple specific and designed to accelerate whatâ€™s called ProRes and ProRes raw codec
     (google says itâ€™s useful for video editors who want to edit raw camera sensor data thus provides more flexibility in post -production).
     Visual learning algorithms MAY be able to utilize this to aid in more accurate learning â€“ just my thoughts, footage captured in low lighting or
    similar difficult conditions could be manipulated to bring the important features into focusâ€¦. Maybe. </p>

    <br></br>

    <h2> Â£400 Wheels? </h2>

     <p>LMAO! Â£400 wheelsâ€¦ That donâ€™t lockâ€¦ Â£50,000 that doesnâ€™t stay still.
    This brings me to my final opinion on the machine although its incredible in most mentionable fields,
    as a developer it doesnâ€™t scream to me as something I would ever need. Custom PCâ€™s builds are far more much cheaper and can achieve similar specs.
    Corporations involved in blockbuster productions seem to be the ideal users and I believe in the near future developers and other â€˜proâ€™ users will
    begin to invest in the machine as they scale their productions. </p>
